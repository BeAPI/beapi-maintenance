# Be API - Maintenance Mode

This simple and lightweight WordPress maintenance plugin puts your WordPress site into maintenance mode. The *major advantage* compared to existing plugins, is that there is no options, it is *ready to use*!

While in maintenance mode, it was think to :
- Not impact your SEO by sending a '503 Service Unavailable' status to all unauthenticated clients. This means that it will inhibits search engines from both losing your site's existing content and indexing your maintenance page as well, so your site will not lose its rankings while it is out of service. Content will even be hidden from consumers of the site's RSS or Atom feeds.
- Make continually work the login/loggout process.
- It handle the *activate process in multisite*, which a lot of existing plugins don't.
- If people are logged in they will have the site displayed as normal/expected.

# How ?

TODO :
- nothing to do
- customize the maintenance mode with custom file (filter)
- - filter
- - template look like
- whitelist (filter)
- - exemple with filter

## How ?

We would like to precise that this plugin is simple as pie, anyone can use it but still dev-oriented. The idea is to not have a bunch of options to set before using it, in fact not only one! Because, it is a really pain when working on a multisite.
That is why there as still two filter for developers, which come in the section below.

## IPs whitelist

In certain conditions, it is useful to not trigger the maintenance mode. That's why you can add a file to your project (mu-plugins) to specify a range of IPs to whitelist. At the agency we use it with our VPN IP.
Please find an example of implementation on the following [github](https://github.com/BeAPI/bea-plugin-defaults/blob/master/default-beapi-maintenance-mode.php) : https://github.com/BeAPI/bea-plugin-defaults/blob/master/default-beapi-maintenance-mode.php
